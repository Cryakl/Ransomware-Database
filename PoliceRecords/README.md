What happened to my computer? Your files are encrypted, meaning that your.
files are converted from Plain Text to Cipher Text. What is Plain Text and Cipher Text? Plain Text
is something readable, but Cipher is some scrambled gibrish, that's what happened to your files right now.
In Order to turn your files into plain text, you need to decryption software, which the ransomware
guarantees to give it to you, once you make the payment. What is going to happen if i am not going to pay ?
Then the countdown will run out and crash your system, making unstable and maybe unbootable. How can i trust?
You have nothing to worry about, because no one would pay us money if we cheated/scammed users.
