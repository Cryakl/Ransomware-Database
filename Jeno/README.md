What Happened to My Computer?
Your important files are encrypted.
Many of your documents, photos, videos, databases and other files are no longer accessible because they have been encrypted. Maybe you are 
busy looking for a way to recover your files, but do not waste your time. Nobody can recover your files without our decryption service.

Can I Recover My Files?
Sure. We guarantee that you can recover all your files safely and easily. But you have not so enough time.
If you want to decrypt all your files, you need to pay.

How Do I Pay?
Payment is accepted in Bitcoin only. For more information, click <About bitcoin>.
Please check the current price of Bitcoin and buy some bitcoins. For more information, click <How to buy bitcoins>.
And send the correct amount to the address specified in this window.
After your payment, click <Check Payment>.
Once the payment is checked, you can start decrypting your files immediately.

We strongly recommend you to not remove this software, and disable your anti-virus for a while, until you pay and the payment gets processed. If 
your anti-virus gets updated and removes this software automatically, it will not be able to recover your files even if you pay!

1. To pay us, you have to use Bitcoin currency. You can easily buy Bitcoins at following sites:
	https://cex.io/
	https://www.binance.com/
	https://www.coinbase.com/
	
2. After then, if you already have Bitcoins, pay us 0.3 BTC on following our Bitcoin address.

3. Then, press the "Check Payment" button. We will automatically decrypt your files, after bitcoin transfer.
