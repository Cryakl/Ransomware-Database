Your personal files have been encrypted!
Your documents, photos, databases and other important files have been encrypted using a military grade encryption algorithm.
The only way to decrypt your files is with a unique decryption key stored remotely in our servers. All your files are now
unusable until you decrypt them. You have 24h to pay for the release of your decryption key. After 24h have passed, your
decryption key will be erased and you will never be able to restore your files.
To obtain your unique decryption key you will need to pay $500 using a PayPal MyCash voucher. 
If the payment is not sent within 12h the amount to obtain your decryption key will be $1000. 
PayPal MyCash vouchers can be purchased at CVS, 7-Eleven, Dollar General, fred`s Super Dollar, 
Family Dollar and many other stores.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After obtaining your PayPal MyCash voucher code you need to send an email to   
silasw9pa@yahoo.co.uk with the following information.
1. Your $500 PayPal MyCash PIN
2. Your encryption ID = User_ID
Shortly after the voucher is received and verified, all your files will be restored to their previous state.
All payments are processed and verified manually, do not try to send invalid PIN numbers.
