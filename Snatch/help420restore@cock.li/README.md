HOW TO RESTORE YOUR FILES.txt
```
```
Hello! All your files are encrypted and only I can decrypt them.
Contact me:

help420restore@cock.li or restore_help@protonmail.com

Write me if you want to return your files - I can do it very quickly!
The header of letter must contain extension of encrypted files.
I'm always reply within 24 hours. If not - check spam folder, resend your letter or try send letter from another email service (like protonmail.com).

Attention!
Do not rename or edit encrypted files: you may have permanent data loss.

To prove that I can recover your files, I am ready to decrypt any three files (less than 1Mb) for free (except databases, Excel and backups)

HURRY UP!
! ! ! If you do not email me in the next 48 hours then your data may be lost permanently ! ! !
