HOW TO RESTORE YOUR FILES.TXT 
```
```
Hello!

All your files are encrypted!

Email me if you want to get your files back - I will do it very quickly!
Contact me by email:

restore_help@mail.fr or help420restore@cock.li

The subject line must contain an encryption extension or the name of your company!
Do not rename encrypted files, you may lose them forever.
You may be a victim of fraud. Free decryption as a guarantee.
Send us up to 3 files for free decryption.
The total file size should be no more than 1 MB! (not in the archive), and the files should not contain valuable information. (databases, backups, large Excel spreadsheets, etc.)


To contact us, we recommend that you create an email address at protonmail.com or tutanota.com
Because gmail and other public email programs can block our messages!

If you do not receive a response from us for a long time, check your spam folder.
