First of all, sorry. It's just business. 

All your files have been encrypted. All your documents are unavailable. 

The encryption was done using a secret key designed by our company.

In order to decrypt your files you must buy an exclusive key from us.

Do not reset or shutdown - files may be damaged.
Do not rename or move encrypted files - they may be lost forever.
Do not try to delete readme files - files may be damaged.

Please send $150k in Bitcoin to the following wallet: bc1qp94vpfjgm6z7fvcsa43cymjpyytweqjju9u7dp

If you do not own Bitcoin yet, we suggest a quick Google search. 

After 24 hours the payment will double. After 48 hours files will be deleted. 

If you have a proposal within 2 hours you will get a discount, minimizing this tragic event so you can get back to work.
