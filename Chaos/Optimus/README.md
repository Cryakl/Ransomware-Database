TIMER WILL START SOON 
This is not a mistake. This is not random. You were chosen deliberately.

Your system is under our complete control. Every file, every memory, every trace of your digital life is encrypted with unbreakable methods. Shutting down your PC or attempting to bypass us will only result in one outcome: you will lose everything, forever.

⏳ THE RULES ARE SIMPLE ⏳
DO NOT CLOSE THE TIMER PROGRAM. It is monitoring your actions. If you try to interfere, your data will be destroyed immediately.
DO NOT TURN OFF YOUR PC. This will trigger irreversible deletion of all your files. You will never get them back.
You have exactly 24 hours to comply. When the timer hits zero, every file on your system will be permanently erased.
WHAT YOU MUST DO
To regain access to your files, you must:

Send $50 in Bitcoin to the following address:
bc1qfx23gwsjtpaefw7tpe23f7fhsswtzjxhqasu9r

Include your unique identifier in the payment notes:  id_6676


Wait for confirmation. Once we verify your payment, the decryption will start
FAILURE HAS CONSEQUENCES
If you:

Close the timer program,
Turn off your PC,
Or fail to pay within the allocated time,
All your data will be lost forever. There will be no second chances, no exceptions, no recovery.

YOUR FUTURE IS IN YOUR HANDS
This is not a game. This is your only chance to reclaim what is yours. The clock is ticking, and every second brings you closer to losing everything.

Do as instructed. Do not test us. Your files depend on it.
