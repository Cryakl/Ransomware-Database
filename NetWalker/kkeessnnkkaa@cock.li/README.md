Hi!
Your files are encrypted.
All encrypted files for this computer has extension: .[Random]

--

If for some reason you read this text before the encryption ended,
this can be understood by the fact that the computer slows down, 
and your heart rate has increased due to the ability to turn it off,
then we recommend that you move away from the computer and accept that you have been compromised,
rebooting/shutdown will cause you to lose files without the possibility of recovery and even god will not be able to help you,
it could be files on the network belonging to other users, sure you want to take that responsibility?

--

Our encryption algorithms are very strong and your files are very well protected, you can't hope to recover them without our help.
The only way to get your files back is to cooperate with us and get the decrypter program.
Do not try to recover your files without a decrypt program, you may damage them and then they will be impossible to recover.

We advise you to contact us as soon as possible, otherwise there is a possibility that your files will never be returned.
For us this is just business and to prove to you our seriousness, we will decrypt you some files for free, 
but we will not wait for your letter for a long time, mail can be abused, we are moving on, hurry up with the decision.
